### x) Additional reading

#### Start your research with a review article:

- Review articles provide a quick view for getting your bearings on subjects of interest. They can be used to gauge the current environment regarding the topic and popular ideas quickly without a large commitment in hours of work.

- Review articles should:
    - Be fresh, preferrably 2 years or newer.
    - Have a JUFO rating of 1 to 3. Higher level is preferable.

- Google scholar can be used as one of the channels for finding articles.

#### A comprehensive review of the state-of-the-art on security and privacy issues in healthcare:

The review is 38 pages in length. As such, I've glanced through the article. 

- Based of previous surveys from 2010 onwards, focusing on improving those findings with additional information and
more holistic view of the stakeholders and healthcare infrastructure as a whole.

- As new technology emerges to help patients in new ways and gives doctors new tools, the attack surface of the healthcare sector expands 
creating new and unique security concerns. These being Implanted and wearable medical devices (IWMDs) that concern the patient and the networking and communication
devices the healthcare infrastructure uses. 

- The attack data on healthcare services is compiled and classified using MITRE classification to present a generalized view on the methods and techniques used
in the real world in the past 15 years.

- Due to the unique attributes that healthcare technology often has, it is paramount to design and use methods specifically made for their respective environments and threats.

- With the information given many areas of improvement was identified, especially regarding patient safety and privacy due to lack of proper security on new
systems and networks. These issues often cause harm to the patient.
